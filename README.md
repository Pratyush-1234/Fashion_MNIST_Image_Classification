# Fashion_MNIST_Image_Classification
This project explores the impact of different input features on the performance of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal is to understand how handcrafted image features influence model generalization and learning behavior.
