# Fashion_MNIST_Image_Classification
This project explores the impact of different input features on the performance of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal is to understand how handcrafted image features influence model generalization and learning behavior.
Training three separate MLP models, each using different input features:
• Model 1: Flattened raw images (1D vector) without any additional preprocessing.
• Model 2: Edge-detection features using techniques like Canny features.
• Model 3: Other transformations, such as HOG features and SIFT features.
